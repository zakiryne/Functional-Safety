This is the project repository for **Elective Project No. 2 Functional Safety**, part of Term 3 _Path Planning, Concentrations, and Systems_ of Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree program, submitted by Albert Killer in Oktober 2017. 

### Project Overview

Goal of this project is to create an example safety case for a lane assistance system considering the **Road Vehicles Functional Safety Standard [ISO 26262](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_26262)**.
We start with a hazard analysis and risk assessment, create further documentation for functional and technical safety concepts and finally software and hardware requirements. 

As a result of this project, following reports were created that document the functional safety of a lane assistance system:
1. Safety Plan 
2. Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment 
3. Functional Safety Concept 
4. Technical Safety Concept and Software Requirements 

This safety case does not contain an entire functional safety analysis from scratch but focuses on parts of a lane assistance system.
